# voprf-ts: A TypeScript Library for Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions (OPRF).

An **Oblivious Pseudorandom Function (OPRF)** is a two-party protocol between a client and server for computing the output of a Pseudorandom Function (PRF).

The server provides the PRF secret key, and the client provides the PRF input.
At the end of the protocol, the client learns the PRF output without learning anything about the PRF secret key, and the server learns neither the PRF input nor output.

A **verifiable OPRF (VOPRF)** ensures clients can verify that the server used a specific private key during the execution of the protocol.

A **partially-oblivious (POPRF)** extends a VOPRF allowing the client and server to provide public shared input to the PRF computation.

This library supports all three modes:
```js
Oprf.Mode.OPRF
Oprf.Mode.VOPRF
Oprf.Mode.POPRF
```
and supports three suites corresponding to the underlying group and hash used:
```js
Oprf.Suite.P256_SHA256
Oprf.Suite.P384_SHA384
Oprf.Suite.P521_SHA512
```

**Specification:** Compliant with IETF [draft-irtf-cfrg-voprf](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-voprf/) and tests vectors match with [v21](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-voprf-21).

### Usage

#### Step 1

First set up a client and a server. In this case, we use the VOPRF mode with suite P384-SHA384.

```js
import {
    Oprf, VOPRFClient, VOPRFServer, generatePublicKey, randomPrivateKey
} from '@cloudflare/voprf-ts';

const suite = Oprf.Suite.P384_SHA384;
const privateKey = await randomPrivateKey(suite);
const publicKey = generatePublicKey(suite, privateKey);

const server = new VOPRFServer(suite, privateKey);
const client = new VOPRFClient(suite, publicKey);
```

#### Step 2

The client prepares arbitrary input[s] that will be batch evaluated by the server. The blinding method produces an evaluation request, and some finalization data to be used later. Then, the client sends the evaluation request to the server.

```js
const input = new TextEncoder().encode("This is the client's input");
const batch = [input]
const [finData, evalReq] = await client.blind(batch);
```

#### Step 3

Once the server received the evaluation request, it responds to the client with an evaluation.

```js
const evaluation = await server.blindEvaluate(evalReq);
```

#### Step 4

Finally, the client can produce the output[s] of the OPRF protocol using the server's evaluation and the finalization data from the second step. If the mode is verifiable, this step allows the client to check the proof that the server used the expected private key for the evaluation.

```js
// Get output matching first input of batch
const [output] = await client.finalize(finData, evaluation);
```

### Integrating the @noble Crypto Backend for Enhanced Performance and Support

This library exposes the `@cloudflare/voprf-ts/crypto-noble` cryptographic backend. The advantages include:

- Improved performance benchmarks.
- Extended support for the Ristretto and Decaf elliptic curve groups:
  ```js
  Oprf.Suite.RISTRETTO255_SHA512
  Oprf.Suite.DECAF448_SHAKE256
  ```

However, users should note the following:

- Arithmetic operations in the `@noble/curves` library leverage native JavaScript's `BigInt`. 
  - These operations inherently operate in non-constant time. 
  - However, noble libraries DO take care to employ constant time (CT) algorithms.
  - In the interest of fairness, it must be noted that `sjcl` is also not perfectly CT either. 
  - As always, **users are encouraged to understand the implications of their chosen cryptographic backend** fully. 

- To incorporate the `CryptoNoble` backend, it is necessary to first install some optional dependencies: `@noble/curves` and `@noble/hashes`.

Dependencies can be installed with the following command:

```bash
npm install @noble/curves @noble/hashes
```

Upon successful installation, the backend can be utilized as illustrated below:

```javascript
import { Crypto } from '@cloudflare/voprf-ts';
import { CryptoNoble } from '@cloudflare/voprf-ts/crypto-noble';

// Ensure you understand the BigInt nuances related to your specific use case!
Crypto.provider = CryptoNoble;

console.log(Crypto.Group.supportedGroups);
// Expected output: [ 'ristretto255', 'decaf448', 'P-256', 'P-384', 'P-521' ]

// Proceed with the library usage as intended.
```

**Dependencies**

This project uses the Stanford Javascript Crypto Library [sjcl](https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl). Support for elliptic curves must be enabled by this compilation step, which produces the necessary files inside the [src/sjcl](./src/sjcl) folder.

```sh
 $ make -f sjcl.Makefile
```
